# Hi, I'm Ilia 👋

I'm a Master's student in **Business Analytics and Big Data** at GSoM, but I actually started out with a Bachelor's in Linguistics. My love for languages ended up turning into a fascination with coding and data, which I'm exploring every day.

## About Me

- **Linguistics Graduate** 📚
  
  Studied how humans communicate, analyzed language data and loved every minute of it.
  
- **Aspiring Analyst** 👨‍💻

  Currently diving into **data**, **statistics** and **management**.

- **Python** 🐍

  Practicing my coding skills, especially in Python.

- **Eager to Grow** 🌱
  
  Always on the lookout for new concepts and tech to explore.

- **Music Enthusiast** 🎶
  
  I tinker with piano and music production in my spare time, nothing fancy, just something to unwind.

## What I’m Up To 
- Taking an additional courses on **ML basics** (a lot of math and a lot of mind-blowing functionality).
- Working on **small projects** to sharpen my data analysis skills and make something useful.
- Reading up on best practices for **data visualization** and **reporting**.
